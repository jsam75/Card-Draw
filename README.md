Springboard SEC useEffect/useRef exercise

This is a useEffect/useRef exercise in React.  I wrote a ton of notes in the code because this was truly a dense learning session.  I drilled down on functionlaity, but still toyed with some CSS just to make it a little cuter.  Still no where near what I would like to experience as a user, myself.  But, by the time I got through the functional part my brain was fried and there was not anything left over for CSS.  
Poor CSS, always an afterthought at this point in a beginner's coding journey.  One day, I hope to do very cool things with it, but it'll have to wait for now.

This is the first React exercise involving API calls.  I did not write these with any error handling.  There is another exercise right after this one and I am hoping to add error heandling next time, stay tuned to see how that goes.
